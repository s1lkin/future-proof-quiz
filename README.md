This quiz application includes:
1. The quiz consists of **2 questions** (one on each screen).
2. The user sees **only one screen at a time**.
3. After answering both questions, a **form for entering an email** is displayed (with validation).
4. After confirming the email, a **final screen** is shown displaying:
    - the entered email;
    - the selected answers.
5. All data (**current step**, **answers**, **email**) are **stored on the client side**, so that everything remains after the page is refreshed.


No additional libraries are used, except for React and development dependencies.

The code includes documentation and comments where necessary to explain logic and structure.
